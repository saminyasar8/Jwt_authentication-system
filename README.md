# Jwt_authentication-system
🗂 Project Structure and Workflow

The main folders of the project (generally based on Golang/Gin) are:

controllers/
✨ Handles HTTP endpoints for user registration, login, etc.

models/
✨ Defines user data structures (e.g., user ID, password).

middleware/
🔐 Adds JWT verification and authorization checks to ensure “protected routes” work properly.

utils/
🔑 Contains functions for JWT token creation, password hashing (bcrypt) and verification, and reading environment variables from the .env file.

main.go
🚀 Contains the setup for routes, server initialization, and start logic.

.env
Stores environment variables, such as JWT_SECRET_KEY.

✅ Features Implemented

Register (POST /register)

Accepts username and password from the user.

Password is hashed using bcrypt and stored in an emulated server store (likely a map or slice for now).

Login (POST /login)

Verifies the username and password.

If correct, generates a JWT using a utils function and sends it in the response.

Middleware Verification (Protected Routes)

Checks the request header for Authorization: Bearer <token>.

Middleware decodes the JWT and validates it.

If invalid or expired, responds with 401/403 and prevents access to the route.

Password Hashing

Uses bcrypt to encode and verify passwords (handled in utils).

Reading from .env

Loads JWT_SECRET_KEY from the environment in utils.

Additional Notes

Database integration (PostgreSQL/MySQL) could be added later in models or a database folder.

Controllers may also include endpoints like /refresh-token or /logout.

A tests/ folder might contain unit or integration tests.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
